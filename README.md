# aiPR â€“ AI-powered Pull Request Reviewer

**aiPR** is an automated code review tool that leverages AI to analyze pull requests on GitHub, enforce customizable code quality rules, and post inline review comments directly on your PRs.

## Features

- **Automated Patch Extraction:** Fetches the latest patch (diff) from a specified GitHub pull request.
- **Changed Line Analysis:** Extracts and processes only the changed lines for focused, efficient review.
- **Customizable Review Rules:** Enforces strict, configurable rules (e.g., camelCase naming, no commented-out code except TODOs, etc.).
- **AI Review Integration:** Uses an AI model to generate review comments based on code changes and rules.
- **Inline GitHub Comments:** Automatically posts AI-generated review comments as inline feedback on the PR.
- **Audit Trail:** Saves intermediate outputs (changed lines, prompts, AI reviews) for transparency and debugging.
